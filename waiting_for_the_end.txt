Yeah
Yo

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, something's empty within 'em

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strenght to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginnig
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady, something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear
