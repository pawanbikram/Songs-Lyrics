Baby this love
I'll never let it die
Can't be touched by no one
I'd like to see 'um try

I'm a mad man for your touch
Girl, I've lost control

I'm gonna make this last forever
Don't tell me it's impossible

Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity

Oh, darling my soul
You know it aches for yours
And you've been filling this hole
Since you were born

Oh, Cause you're the reason I believe in fate
You're my paradise
And I'll do anything to be your love or be your sacrifies

Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity

Meet me at the bottom of the ocean
Where the time is frozen
Where all the universe is open
Love isn't random
We are chosen

And we could wear the same crown
Keep slowing your heart down
We are the gods now

Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
